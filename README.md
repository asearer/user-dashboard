# User Dashboard

## Overview

The **User Dashboard** is a frontend demo application designed to showcase a modern and visually appealing interface for managing and visualizing various data metrics. The application employs the neumorphism design trend, which combines soft shadows and highlights to create a tactile, almost 3D appearance on user interface elements. This project currently serves as a frontend-only demo, providing a solid foundation for further development and integration with backend services.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the **User Dashboard** is to offer a proof-of-concept for a user-friendly and engaging dashboard interface. This demo is ideal for developers exploring neumorphic design and teams considering this design trend for their applications.

- **UI/UX Demonstration**: Showcases how neumorphic design can enhance user engagement and create a visually pleasing experience.
- **Frontend Development**: Serves as a template or starting point for building a more complete dashboard solution.
- **Learning Resource**: Useful for developers who want to learn how to implement neumorphic design principles using React and CSS.

## Features

- **Neumorphic Design**: A consistent, soft UI design that enhances the user experience.
- **Statistics Display**: Visually appealing cards that display key metrics and data points.
- **Task Management**: A task list that allows users to track and update their ongoing tasks.
- **User Profiles**: A detailed view of user information, including roles, bios, and skills.
- **Responsive Layout**: Ensures a seamless experience across various screen sizes and devices.

## Tech Stack

The **User Dashboard** is built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend Framework**: [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where data changes over time.
  
- **CSS Framework**: [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - A widely-used CSS framework that offers responsive design elements. The project makes extensive use of custom CSS for neumorphic design, in conjunction with Bootstrap's grid system and components.
  
- **Styling**: Custom CSS - The neumorphic design is achieved through custom CSS that applies specific box shadows, border-radius, and other styling techniques to create the soft, three-dimensional effect.

- **Package Manager**: [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) - Node Package Manager is used to manage dependencies and scripts for building and running the project.

- **Development Tools**:
  - **Visual Studio Code**: A source-code editor with support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, and more.
  - **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs.
  - **Prettier**: A code formatter that enforces a consistent style by parsing code and re-printing it with its own rules.

## Installation

To set up and run the **User Dashboard** locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/asearer/user-dashboard.git
   cd user-dashboard
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Use npm to install the necessary packages.
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**:
   Start the React development server.
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Access the Dashboard**:
   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the dashboard.

## Usage

As a frontend demo, the **User Dashboard** provides an interactive interface where you can:

- **View Statistics**: The statistics section provides key metrics in a visually engaging format. Hovering over each card provides a slight interactive effect.
  
- **Manage Tasks**: Use the task list to track your work. Each task is labeled with a status, and the list supports status updates.

- **User Profile**: Navigate to the user profile section to view detailed information about users, including their role, bio, and skills.

## Important Notes

- **Frontend-Only**: This project is currently a frontend-only demo. It does not include any backend logic, data storage, or API integrations. All data is hardcoded within the components for demonstration purposes.
  
- **Future Enhancements**: This demo can be extended by integrating it with a backend service (e.g., Node.js, Python/Django, etc.), adding user authentication, and connecting to a database for persistent data storage.
